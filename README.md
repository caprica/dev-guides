# dev-guides

This project contains various short guides for a variety of software development topics.

The intent is to distil product documentation into focussed, consise guides with a sequence of simple and clear steps to achieve some goal.

The guides do not cover every aspect of a topic, but they should be enough to get started with something that actually works.

The intended audience is for teams just starting out on the topic, not for already experienced practitioners.

## Current Guides

Guides are grouped loosely by broad topic areas.

### devops

Currently focussed on getting going with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).

The goal here is to start from zero, create a source code repository, build the project, build a docker image and deploy it to AWS.

 * [AWS SSH setup for CodeCommit](devops/aws-ssh.md)
 * [AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)](devops/aws-elasticcontainerregistry.md)
 * [AWS CodeCommit](devops/aws-codecommit.md)
 * [AWS CodeBuild](devops/aws-codebuild.md)

Everything described in these guides, so far, has been tested and shown to be working in AWS.
